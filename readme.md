### Key Criteria
These are some of the main items our judges will consider. You do not need to meet all key criteria, but you may earn extra points for doing so. This list is intended as a summary, and does not override the specifications of the scenario above.
- Consider the practices in The Community Book of PowerShell Practices (linked at http://powershell.org/wp/newsletter)
- Avoid aliases, except for â€“Object cmdlets; avoid positional parameters and truncated parameter names.
- Use appropriate error handling.
- Use appropriate means of displaying output, progress messages, errors, etc.
- When appropriate, manage pipeline input correctly
- When appropriate, validate input via parameter validation attributes
- Provide help for all scripts and functions, including examples
- Script filenames should include production date for versioning
- Use modular programming practices to maximize opportunities to share code
- Use appropriate remote connectivity protocol(s), including, where appropriate, failover to backup protocols
- Produce appropriate CSV file for initial scan; other formats including XML are permitted.
- Input is subnet, not a range
- Report includes IP addresses with no response as well as responses
- Service pack reported (or report no service pack)
- Investigative routines can accept input from pipeline, or single machines
- Investigative routines are modular, which may include them being separate scripts
- Graphical reports available
- PowerPoint file including graphs is produced

As is often the case in Windows PowerShell, there will be many ways to complete these objectives. In most cases, judges will prefer approaches that:
- Perform well under the load specified
- Leverage built-in functionality of Windows PowerShell rather than reinventing the wheel
- Are the most straightforward and easy to read and understand
